                quality to brain function, but knowing it’s good for you doesn’t always mean it’s easy to go to the gym.
                If you’ve been having trouble getting into a workout routine, take a look at a few proven methods for
                getting off the couch and breaking a sweat.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">If you’re just looking to get active, there’s nothing wrong with going
                to a gym and investing time in whatever equipment or activity strikes your fancy. But the downside of
                those aimless visits is that skipping them doesn’t feel like you’re impeding progress toward a goal.
                After a break-in period, it’s best to imagine a finish line—losing weight, increasing endurance, adding
                muscle, or a mixture of each—and focus your energy on working toward it.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">We all know that going to the gym is good for your health and we are all
                aware that we should be a bit more active. Joining a gym makes doing these things a lot easier but if
                you needed some more motivation, here’s 10 great reasons to join a gym:
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                1. It’s good for your health
                We’re stating the obvious with this one but did you know that being active daily reduces the risk of
                heart disease, strokes and type 2 diabetes?<br>
                2. It’s good for your mind
                When you exercise, endorphins are released which can calm anxiety and lift your mood.<br>
                3. It’s a great stress buster
                Had a busy day? There is nothing more rewarding then running further or lifting heavier than you have
                before. Plus, the fitter you get, the better your body is at regulating cortisol levels (the hormone
                linked to stress).<br>
                4. Access to equipment
                Being a member of a gym means you have access to tons of equipment, allowing you to keep your routine
                fresh and exciting.<br>

    <section class="section section-left">
        <div class="paras">
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> 5. Access to knowledge
                If you’re a workout newbie, a gym membership can give you the tools and knowledge to start out. Learn
                the ropes by booking on the induction programme, attending classes or even get a Personal Trainer<br>
                6. It keeps you motivated
                Going to the gym and being surrounded by motivated people can encourage you to stay on track. Plus,
                having somewhere to go sounds more appealing then working out in the park or in your living room.<br>
                7. You get an all-weather workout
                Ever binned off a run because it was raining? Ditched the outdoor bootcamp because it was dark? The gym
                offers a great place to work out whatever the weather and time of year, so no excuses!<br>
                8. Meet like-minded people
                Joining a gym can be quite social. If you’re a regular at classes, then you begin to get to know people
                and before you know it you’re lifelong friends.<br>
                9. It will improve your sleep
                Studies show that people who exercise 5 to 6 times a week are more likely to get a good night’s kip.<br>
                10. You can have somewhere to relax
                Generally, people join a gym to workout but they are actually a great place to unwind. A gentle swim or
                sit in the sauna for some ‘me time’ will have you zen before you know it.</p>
