                    sleep
                    quality to brain function, but knowing it’s good for you doesn’t always mean it’s easy to go to the
                    gym.
                    If you’ve been having trouble getting into a workout routine, take a look at a few proven methods
                    for
                    getting off the couch and breaking a sweat.</p>

                    going
                    to a gym and investing time in whatever equipment or activity strikes your fancy. But the downside
                    of
                    those aimless visits is that skipping them doesn’t feel like you’re impeding progress toward a goal.
                    After a break-in period, it’s best to imagine a finish line—losing weight, increasing endurance,
                    adding
                    muscle, or a mixture of each—and focus your energy on working toward it.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">We all know that going to the gym is good for your health and we are
                    all
                    aware that we should be a bit more active. Joining a gym makes doing these things a lot easier but
                    if
                    you needed some more motivation, here’s 10 great reasons to join a gym:
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                    1. It’s good for your health
                    We’re stating the obvious with this one but did you know that being active daily reduces the risk of
                    heart disease, strokes and type 2 diabetes?<br>
                    2. It’s good for your mind
                    When you exercise, endorphins are released which can calm anxiety and lift your mood.<br>
                    3. It’s a great stress buster
                    Had a busy day? There is nothing more rewarding then running further or lifting heavier than you
                    have
                    before. Plus, the fitter you get, the better your body is at regulating cortisol levels (the hormone
                    linked to stress).<br>
                    4. Access to equipment
                    Being a member of a gym means you have access to tons of equipment, allowing you to keep your
                    routine
                    fresh and exciting.<br>

                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="thumbnail">
                <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/900x900/?gym,yoga" alt="image" class="imgFluid">
            </div>
        </section>
        <section class="section section-left">
            <div class="paras">
                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> 5. Access to knowledge
                    If you’re a workout newbie, a gym membership can give you the tools and knowledge to start out.
                    Learn
                    the ropes by booking on the induction programme, attending classes or even get a Personal
                    Trainer<br>
                    6. It keeps you motivated
                    Going to the gym and being surrounded by motivated people can encourage you to stay on track. Plus,
                    having somewhere to go sounds more appealing then working out in the park or in your living
                    room.<br>
                    7. You get an all-weather workout
                    Ever binned off a run because it was raining? Ditched the outdoor bootcamp because it was dark? The
                    gym
                    offers a great place to work out whatever the weather and time of year, so no excuses!<br>
                    8. Meet like-minded people
                    Joining a gym can be quite social. If you’re a regular at classes, then you begin to get to know
                    people
                    and before you know it you’re lifelong friends.<br>
                    9. It will improve your sleep
                    Studies show that people who exercise 5 to 6 times a week are more likely to get a good night’s
                    kip.<br>
                    10. You can have somewhere to relax
                    Generally, people join a gym to workout but they are actually a great place to unwind. A gentle swim
                    or
                    sit in the sauna for some ‘me time’ will have you zen before you know it.</p>
